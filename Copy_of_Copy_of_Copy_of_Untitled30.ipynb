        "\n",
        "It is a branch of mathmatics concerned with the analysis of decision-making and strategy. It is applied in economics,biology and behavioral science. Game theory is used to determine different strategy to compete with one another. Game theory is also used in everyday life to make decision like when to change lanes in traffic, when to cross the road or even when to do your assignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Game theory gained widespread recognition in early $1940's$ when it was applied to the theoretical study of economics by mathematician John Von Newmann and the economist Oskar Morgenstern in their book theory of games and economic behaviors. since then its scopes broadened to co-operative interaction as well as in applied theoretical aspects of social sciences.\n",
        "\n",
        "the Nash equilibrium is a decision that does not deviate no matter what the other player chooses. It benefits person A no matter what person B does. Although it is not necessarily the optimal decision for both.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other word, game theory can also be defined as the mathmatical study of decision-making, of conflict and strategy in social situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "What motivated us to work on this subject is that none of us really knew what game theory was! We didn't really know how to use it or what it's applications were. So our main driving force was the pursuit of knowledge!\n",

        "Our main focus of game theory has been the Nash Equilibrium. A pair of strategies is said to be Nash equilibrium (NE), if optimal choice of Player A given Player B’s choice coincides with optimal choice of Player B given Player A’s choice. In simple terms, initially neither player knows what the other player will do when deciding or making a choice. Hence NE is a pair of choices/strategies/expectations where neither player wants to change their behaviour even after the strategy/choice of the other player is revealed.\n",
        " Another one of the main ideas we have looked at is dominant strategy. In dominant strategy there is one optimal strategy for each player irrespective of what strategy the other player adopts. Whatever choice B makes, A should always choose Bottom and whatever choice A makes B should always choose Left."
