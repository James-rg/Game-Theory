        "\n",
        "It is a branch of mathmatics concerned with the analysis of decision-making and strategy. It is applied in economics,biology and behavioral science. Game theory is used to determine different strategy to compete with one another. Game theory is also used in everyday life to make decision like when to change lanes in traffic, when to cross the road or even when to do your assignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Game theory gained widespread recognition in early $1940's$ when it was applied to the theoretical study of economics by mathematician John Von Newmann and the economist Oskar Morgenstern in their book theory of games and economic behaviors. since then its scopes broadened to co-operative interaction as well as in applied theoretical aspects of social sciences.\n",
        "\n",
        "the Nash equilibrium is a decision that does not deviate no matter what the other player chooses. It benefits person A no matter what person B does. Although it is not necessarily the optimal decision for both.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other word, game theory can also be defined as the mathmatical study of decision-making, of conflict and strategy in social situations.\n",

        " In 1921, a French mathematician and politician Émile Borel (1871–1956) published several papers on the $Theory$ $Of$ $Games$. he was known as forgotten father of game theory and famous for his founding work in the areas of measure theory and probability. Aspects of game theory were first explored by the French mathematician Émile Borel (1871–1956), who wrote several papers on games of chance and theories of play.\n",
        "\n",
        " The acknowledged father of **Game Theory**, however, is the Hungarian-American mathematician John von Neumann, who in a series of papers in the 1920s and ’30s established the mathematical framework for all subsequent theoretical developments. During World War II he was a military strategists in such areas as logistics, submarine warfare, and air defense he drew on ideas that were directly related to game theory. Game theory thereafter developed within the context of the social sciences. Despite such empirically related interests, it is essentially a product of mathematicians. \n",

        "Our main focus of game theory has been the **Nash Equilibrium**. \n",
        "\n",
        "The **Nash Equilibrium** is a way of optimizing an outcome named after John Forbes Nash Jr. However it was first utilized by Antoine Augustin Cournot who was a French philosopher and mathematician. \n",
        "\n",
        "The **Nash Equilibrium** is a very unique way of observing decisions in a very absolute way.A pair of strategies is said to be **Nash Equilibrium** (NE), if the optimal choice of Player A given Player B’s choice coincides with optimal choice of Player B given Player A’s choice. In simple terms, initially neither player knows what the other player will do when deciding or making a choice. Hence NE is a pair of choices/strategies/expectations where neither player wants to change their behaviour even after the strategy/choice of the other player is revealed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "As you can see the **Nash Equilibrium** is fairly straightforward. It is simple in a sense that each individual always tries to maximize their own outcome. However, in the real world it isn't always absolute or predictable. It is very hard to predict people!\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " Another one of the main ideas we have looked at is dominant strategy. In **Dominant Strategy** there is one optimal strategy for each player irrespective of what strategy the other player adopts. Whatever choice B makes, A should always choose Bottom and whatever choice A makes B should always choose Left."
